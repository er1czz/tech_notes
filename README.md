- **Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe** - by Roger Mcnamee

*"The economy is creating part-time jobs with no benefits and no security - driving for Uber or Lyft, for example - but not creating jobs that support a middle-class lifestyle, in part because that has not been a priority. One opportunity for the government is to create tax incentive for tech business (and others) to retrain and create jobs for workers threatened by recent changes in the economy. Teaching everyone to code is not the answer, as coding will likely be an early target for automation through artificial inttelligence."*

*"I see no easy solution to the problems posed by Facebook and the other internet platforms. They are deeply entrenched. Users trust them, despite an abusive relationship. To contain the problem somwhere near current levels, the first step shoud be a combination of antitrust enforcement and new regulations to protect privacy and to limit the scope of data collection and artificial intelligence."*

*"Let me be clear. I do not believe the employees at Google, Facebook, or Twitter ever imagined their products would harm democracy in the United States or anywhere else. But the systems they built are doing just that. By manipulating attention, isolating users in filter and preference bubbles, and leaving them vulnerable to invasions of privacy, loss of agency, and even behavior modification, internet platforms inadvertently created a weapon for those who would impose their will on the powerless."*

# What makes a good data scientist? (DJ Patil)
- **Technical expertise**: the best data scientists typically have deep expertise in some scientific discipline.
- **Curiosity**: a desire to go beneath the surface and discover and distill a problem down into a very clear set of hypotheses that can be tested.
- **Storytelling**: the ability to use data to tell a story and to be able to communicate it effectively.
- **Cleverness**: the ability to look at a problem in different, creative ways.

# Cultivate conditions for team success
- 1. communicate with intent
- 2. inspire to generate action
- 3. understand what motivate each team member (e.g. direct praise, quiet reinforcement, more responsibilities)
- 4. encourage risk-taking
- 5. leverage diversity (different angles)
- 6. lead by examples (set examples, a tone that balances authority & humility)

# From manager to leader 
#### Enhance personal growth
- Self-awareness
- Executive presence (image, demeanor, leadership)
- Emotional intelligence

#### Commite to people and relationships
- Coach
- Network
###### Strong - vulnerable, Decisive - flexible, Strategic - creative, Outgoing - introspective

# Others
Update environment and package (step order): 
```
    $ brew update 
    $ brew upgrade
    $ conda update -n base conda    
    $ conda update --all
```
Tips: in terminal, type <b>!j</b> will start last command start with <b>*j*</b> such as 'jupyter notebook'.

# Product ideas
- Automate Image Scraping of Xrays
- Predict the starting timestamp of video main content (skip the intro) of YouTube

# Create new conda environment and package installation (CHC)
- ``conda install anaconda``
- ``conda update --all``
- ``pip install aip-cli --extra-index-url https://artifactory.healthcareit.net/artifactory/api/pypi/ai-python-snapshot/simple``
- ``pip install PyAthena``
- ``conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions``

# Generic keyboard mapping on Mac
- Go to Keyboard, then Modifer Keys ...
    - Swap Option Key with Command Key
- Verified by Mac build-in 'Keyboard Viewer'
- Wired connnection is always reliable. Wireless connection: non-BT is slightly better.
