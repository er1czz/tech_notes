*“I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” - Maya Angelou*

# What makes a good data scientist? (DJ Patil)
- **Technical expertise**: the best data scientists typically have deep expertise in some scientific discipline.
- **Curiosity**: a desire to go beneath the surface and discover and distill a problem down into a very clear set of hypotheses that can be tested.
- **Storytelling**: the ability to use data to tell a story and to be able to communicate it effectively.
- **Cleverness**: the ability to look at a problem in different, creative ways.

# Cultivate conditions for team success
- 1. communicate with intent
- 2. inspire to generate action
- 3. understand what motivate each team member (e.g. direct praise, quiet reinforcement, more responsibilities)
- 4. encourage risk-taking
- 5. leverage diversity (different angles)
- 6. lead by examples (set examples, a tone that balances authority & humility)

# From manager to leader

###### Strong - vulnerable, Decisive - flexible, Strategic - creative, Outgoing - introspective

# Others
Update environment and package (step order): 
```
    $ brew update 
    $ brew upgrade
    $ conda update -n base conda    
    $ conda update --all
```
Tips: in terminal, type <b>!j</b> will start last command start with <b>*j*</b> such as 'jupyter notebook'.

# Mapping generic keyboard on Mac
- Go to Keyboard, then Modifer Keys ...
    - Swap Option Key with Command Key
- Verified by Mac build-in 'Keyboard Viewer'
- Wired connnection is always reliable. Wireless connection: non-BT is slightly better.
