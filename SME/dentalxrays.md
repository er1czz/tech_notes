- Buccal Object Rule (SLOB: Same Lingual, Opposite Buccal)
  - Lingual object moves the same direction (lingual: related to the tongue)
  - Buccal object moves the opposite direction (buccal: related to the cheek)

#### Universal (#A - J) for primary dentition

#### basic terminology

- Upper teeth (maxilla bone, maxillary arch)
- Lower teeth (mandible bone, mandibular arch)
- anterior teeth: incisors and canines
- posteior teeth: premolars and molars
- primary dentition (baby teeth: 6 months) vs permanent dentition (6 years)
  - eruption (coming in) vs exfoliation (coming out): e.g. eruption of permanent teeth exfoliate the primary teeth.
  - mixed dentition (6 years to 12 years)

#### Directional Terms: (5 concepts: F, L, M, D, O)
- **F**acial surfaces: outer surface of teeth
- **L**ingual surfaces: inner surface of teeth
- Midline (split the mounth left and right mirrior symmetry)
  -  **M**esial surface: point to the midline
  -  **D**istal surface: point away from the midline
- **O**cclusal surface: biting and chewing

- Anterior vs posterior 
  -  labial surfaces: facial surfaces of anterior teeth
  -  buccal surfaces: facial surfaces of posterior teeth
  -  incisal surfaces: occlusal surfaces of incisors and canines

#### Tooth anatomy 
- Enamel (96% w.t. mineral), Dentin (70%), Gums (aka. gingiva), Bone (65%), Pulp
  - Cementum (65%): outmost layer of the tooth below the enamel
  - Peridontal ligament (PDL): tissue connect tooth and jaw
  - Junction between cementum and enamel (CEJ): reliable landmark
    -  above CEJ: anatomic crown
    -  below CEJ: anatomic root
      - in some cases, gum recedes, clinical crown (visually visible) & clinical root (visualy invisible) can be different from anatomic concepts
  - Apex: tip of the root (apical / coronal directions)
  
- Pulp
  - pulp chamber
  - pulp horns
  - root canal

#### Dental disease
1. Tooth decay: loss of mineral structure
2. Gum disease: biofilm (plaque), gingivitis --> periodontitis (bone loss)

#### ADA glossary
- Abrasion: wear on the teeth by physical repetitive motions, e.g. brushing / rubbing too hard
- Amalgam: silver filling
- Band (treatment): metal ring around a tooth with cement
- bicuspid: premolar, two cusps (pointed areas)
- bonding: process of filling materials / orthodontic brackets attached to a tooth 
- Bruxism: excessive teeth grinding (usually unconscious)
- Calculus: tartar
- Cusp: pointed part on the top of a tooth
- Dry socket: painful condition when a permanent adult tooth is extracted. Dry socket is when the blood clot at the site of the tooth extraction fails to develop, or it dislodges or dissolves before the wound has healed. Normally, a blood clot forms at the site of a tooth extraction.
- Endodontist: specialists who treat tooth nerve or pulp or infections in the bone associated with infected nerves (e.g. RCT)
- Erosion: loss or wearing of dental hard tissue by acids but Not by bacteria
- Extraction: removal of all or part of a tooth
- Malocclusion
- Mouthguard
- Nightguard: protect from bruxism
- Occlusion: contact of teeth 
- Orthodontist: specialists correcting the position of teeth with braces and others
- Palate: hard and soft tissues that form the roof of the mouth
- Pediatric dentist
- Periodontal pocket
- Periodontist: specialist peridontal tissues surround the teeth
- Prothesis: artificial replacement
- Restoration: aka. filling
- Retainer: removable device hold position of teeth
- Root canal treatment: usually follow with crown procedures, espeicall for posterior teeth 
- Sublingual: undert the tongue
- TMJ: Temporomandibular joint
- TMD: Temporomandibular joint disorder
- Xerostomia: dry mouth
- Extraction:
