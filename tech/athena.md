# AWS Athena is based on Presto SQL, which may take some time to get comfortable with. 
#### note: 
- To make a comment or note, use " **--** note_text" or "**/*** note_text ***/**"
- SQL best practice: Correctness, readability, then optimization; 
- Athena query is case sensitive (Upper case and lower case keywords lead to different functions); 
- In Athena, if you select certain section with cursor, Athena will only run the selected section (this feature comes in handy for debugging long queries);
- To date, creating tables can only be done in Athena not PyAthena; 
- Quotation " " is different from ' '.
- Be patient. Often the error is caused by typo, especially the extra *comma* before **FROM**; 
- Once you ran a complicated query successfully, make a copy just in case. 
- Reminder: Direct copying from text editors such as MS Word can sometimes cause error due to autocorrection such as replacing ' with â€˜.

## 1. [Setup](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/run-sql-queries-from-your-sagemaker-notebooks-using-amazon-athena/) (assume you have installed the perm to access AWS S3)   
   import sys  
   !{sys.executable} -m pip install PyAthena  

   from pyathena import connect  
   import pandas as pd  
   conn = connect(s3_staging_dir='your_query_location_can_be_found_in_Athena_settings',  region_name='YOUR REGION, for example, us-east-1')  

   test = pd.read_sql("""  
   SELECT *  
   FROM "db"."table"  
   LIMIT 3  
   ;""", conn)  

#### (Note: pay attention to the number of quotation marks, different from the AWS tutorial which is strangly not working).

## 2. How to convert a numerical string to date (e.g. 20201010 to 2020-10-10)  
   DATE(DATE_PARSE('20201010', '%y%m%d'))  
   
## 3. Day of the week, Week of the year
  - EXTRACT(DAY_OF_WEEK FROM DATE('2020-10-10'))     (e.g. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7).   
  - DATE_FORMAT(DATE('2020-10-10'), '%W')   (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, ..., Sunday). 
  - EXTRACT(WEEK FROM DATE('2020-10-10'))     (e.g. 1,2,3,..., 53).  
   
## 4. How to calculate weekdays (my way, many popular methods are not applicable to Athena) 
To calculate weekdays is essentially to calcualte weekends.  
e.g. 2020-12-03 (Thu) to 2020-12-16 (Wed) across three weeks but only one whole week.  
- - 2020-12-03 (Thu) to 2020-12-04 (Fri): 1. 
- - 2020-12-07 (Mon) to 2020-12-11 (Fri): 5. 
- - 2020-12-14 (Mon) to 2020-12-16 (Wed): 3. 
- - - Two weekends (four days in total), 9 business days. (9 business days = 13 days - 4 days). 
#### Note:
- In Python Pandas, len(pd.bdate_range('2020-12-03', '2020-12-14')) **-1** = 9. 
- In Office Excel, NETWORKDAYS(date1, date2) **- 1** = 9. 

#### In Athena,
**DATE_DIFF, DATE_TRUNC, DATE_FORMAT, and CASE**  

#### <<<<<<<< week 1 >>>>>>> start_date >>
#### <<<<<<<< week x >>>>>>> end_date >>
#### Note: Drawing the timeline (bulk) on a sketch paper is helpful to understand their relationship.

### 4.1 How many days between start_date and end_date:   
    DATE_DIFF('DAY', DATE(start_date), DATE(end_date))  

### 4.2 How many weeks between start_date and end_date:   
    DATE_DIFF('WEEK', DATE_TRUC('WEEK', start_date), DATE_TRUNC('WEEK', end_date))    

### 4.2.1 Edge cases I, what if start date is in the weekend:   
    (CASE WHEN DATE_FORMAT(start_date, '%W') = 'Saturday' THEN -1   
    WHEN DATE_FORMAT(start_date, '%W') = 'Sunday' THEN -2   
    ELSE 0 END).  

### 4.2.2 Edge case II, what if end date is in the weekend:   
    (CASE WHEN DATE_FORMAT(end_date, '%W') = 'Saturday' THEN +1   
    WHEN DATE_FORMAT(end_date, '%W') = 'Sunday' THEN +2   
    ELSE 0 END)     

### To sum up, how many days of weekends between start_date and end_date:    
    (DATE_DIFF('WEEK', DATE_TRUC('WEEK', start_date), DATE_TRUNC('WEEK', end_date))) x 2 + 
    (CASE WHEN DATE_FORMAT(start_date, '%W') = 'Saturday' THEN -1 WHEN DATE_FORMAT(start_date, '%W') = 'Sunday' THEN -2 ELSE 0 END) +  
    (CASE WHEN DATE_FORMAT(end_date, '%W') = 'Saturday' THEN +1 WHEN DATE_FORMAT(end_date, '%W') = 'Sunday' THEN +2 ELSE 0 END)  
    AS weekend_day.   
### Therefore, how many weekdays: DATE_DIFF('DAY', DATE(start_date), DATE(end_date)) - **weekend_day**

## 5. Add / minus 7 days of a given date: 
    DATE_ADD('day', 7, DATE(given_date)) 
    DATE_ADD('day', -7, DATE(given_date))

## 6. Improve readability with CTE (Common Table Expressions)
    WITH Table_x AS (SELECT ... FROM Original_table)  
    SELECT ...  
    FROM Table_x  
## 7. Window functions (with OVER)
    ROW_NUMBER():  for rows that have duplicate values,numbers are arbitarily assigned., e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, ...    
    RANK(): 1, 1, 1, 4, ...  
    DENSE_RANK(): 1, 1, 1, 2, ...  
    LAG() AND LEAD(): LAG pulls from previous rows and LEAD pulls from following rows.  
### To date, Athena does not support window alias.
## 8. Regular Expression
    Keep only alphabetic value of a column of strings: 
    - array_join(regexp_extract_all((column_name), '[a-zA-Z]+'),'')  
    Keep only alphanumeric value of a column of strings: 
    - array_join(regexp_extract_all((column_name), '[a-zA-Z0-9]+'),'')  
    Keep only numeric value of a column of strings: 
    - array_join(regexp_extract_all((column_name), '[0-9]+'),'')  
    
## 9. Tricks

**When you join two tables, specify the larger table on the left side of join** and the smaller table on the right side of the join. Presto distributes the table on the right to worker nodes, and then streams the table on the left to do the join. If the table on the right is smaller, then there is less memory used and the query runs faster.

**Aggregate function on Athena**
```
    ARRAY_JOIN(ARRAY_DISTINCT(ARRAY_SORT(ARRAY_AGG(value))), ', ') AS values
```

**To tell if an array contains elements of interest e.g. 'A', 'B', 'C'**
```
IF ARRAY[cardinality(ARRAY_DISTINCT(target_array)) + 3 = 
   cardinality(ARRAY_DISTINCT(CONCAT(target_array, ARRAY['A', 'B', 'C'])))
THEN False
ELSE True
```
- Using cardinality is more intutitive and reliable than *contains*

**To automate Athena**
```
def sampler(value='123xyz'):
   import pandas as pd
   from pyathena import connect

   s3_dir = 's3://xxx'
   region = 'xxx'
   conn = connect(s3_staging_dir= s3_dir, region_name= region)
    
   query = """
   SELECT  *
   FROM "db_xxx"."table_xxx"  
   WHERE id IN ('123xyz')
   ;  """
    
   query = query.replace('123xyz',value)
   sample = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
    
   return sample
```
**alternatively**  
```
   from pyathena.pandas.util import as_pandas  
   
   cursor = connect(s3_staging_dir=STAGIN_DIR, region_name=REGION).cursor()  
   query = ...  
   cursor.execute(query)  
   df = as_pandas(cursor)  
```

## Redshift
### [Setup](https://pypi.org/project/redshift-connector/) in Jupyter Notebook (the password can be retrieved from the AWS secret)

```
import pandas as pd
import redshift_connector

conn = redshift_connector.connect(
    host=' ',
    port= ,
    database=' ',
    user=' ',
    password=' ')

query = """select t.table_schema,
       t.table_name,
       c.column_name
from information_schema.tables t
inner join information_schema.columns c
           on c.table_name = t.table_name
           and c.table_schema = t.table_schema
where c.column_name like '%xyz%'
      and t.table_schema not in ('information_schema', 'pg_catalog')
      and t.table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
order by t.table_schema;"""

cursor: redshift_connector.Cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(query)
df: pd.DataFrame = cursor.fetch_dataframe()
display(df)
```

- The query above can find a column with a particular name from all of the tables in Redshift [original link](https://www.charlenecassar.com/2019/09/10/find-a-column-with-a-particular-name-from-all-of-the-tables-in-redshift/)

- Redshift recognizes operators :: and || better than CAST and CONCAT
   - ```cast(pricepaid as integer)```
   - ```pricepaid::integer```
   - ```select concat('December 25, ', '2008');```
   - ```select 'December 25, '||'2008';```
