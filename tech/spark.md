# Apache Spark Essential Training by Ben Sullins
## Apache Spark 
- A fast and general engine for large-scale data processing
- speed: much faster than Hadoopp MapReduce
- ease of use: natively support Java, Python, Scala, R, ANSI SQL
- generality: Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, MLlib, GraphX
- platform agnostic: transactional consistency 

## 
- Spark Core
  - Foundational component
  - Task distribution
  - Scheduling
  - Input / Output
- Spark SQL
  - DataFrames 
- Spark Streaming
  -  Streaming analytics
  -  Micro batches
  -  Lambda architecture (update aggregation)
- MLlib
  - Machine Learning
  - 9x faster than Apache Mahout
  - Includes common functions
- GraphX
  - Graph processing
  - In-memory version of Apache Giraph
  - Based on RDDs
- SparkR 
  - R package for Spark
  - Distributed DataFrames
  - R Studio integration

## Shines
- Integration (ETL: extract, transform, and load)
- ML, BI
- Real-time processing
- Recommendation Engines

## Databricks
- a cloud-based managed platform for running Apache Spark
- implementation of Spark to help reduce complexity of setup and operation

## Databricks Terminology
- Workspaces
- Notebooks (collection of cells containing code and markdown. used to perform analysis: Scala, Python, Java, SQL)
- Libraries
- Tables
- Clusters
- Jobs
